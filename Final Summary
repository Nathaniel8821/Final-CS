My project goals are a little different, I felt like it was hard for me to learn and pick up on things. I want tomake a code about a maze
Instructions- The player needs to navigate through the a mzae using arrow keys and avoid hitting the obstacles to reach the goal. 
My process with this was different, i wanted it to be challenging but capable of doing it as well. 
My technologies and tyechniques used was the gaming language, game loop, input handeling, functions, user interaction, console based interface, and proceduarl generation.
My reflection on this class was hard. I liked the class and how you taught but coming in it had already felt as if everybody was ahead of me and I was already playing catch up up. I would like to improve everything. It was hard to stay on track only because everyone was so far ahead and I didn't ask questions. You are a great teacher


 defined constants for maze dimensions, player symbol, maze symbols, and directions.
 implemented functions to initialize the maze, display the maze, check if the player has won, move the player, and the main function to run the game.
The initialize_maze function creates a maze with random obstacles and places the goal randomly within the maze.
The display_maze function prints the current state of the maze with the player's position.
The has_won function checks if the player's position matches the goal position.
The move_player function updates the player's position based on the input direction.
The play_game function runs the main game loop, allowing the player to make moves until they reach the goal.
